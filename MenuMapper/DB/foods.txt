    1 egg, beaten

Instructions:

    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
    Place the sliced eggplants on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt, and let them sit for about 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.
    Brush the eggplant slices with olive oil and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes until tender and slightly golden.
    In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic. Cook until softened.
    Add ground lamb or beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.
    Stir in diced tomatoes, dried oregano, ground cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.
    In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for a minute.
    Gradually whisk in milk, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens. Add ground nutmeg and grated Parmesan cheese. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Then stir in the beaten egg.
    In a baking dish, layer half of the roasted eggplant slices. Spread the meat mixture over the eggplant. Top with the remaining eggplant slices.
    Pour the sauce evenly over the top.
    Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
    Allow it to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
